# Lesson

 * In Java, file name and the contained class name has to match only for public classes
 * So this makes it possible to have only one or zero public classes in a file
 * The access modifiers a class can have are public and unspecified or default
 * The public classes are accessible outside the package.
 * The default (or unspecified) classes are not accessible outside the package
